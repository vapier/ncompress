compress version 4.2.1 improvements
	* Change the name to ncompress because of version problems.
	* Completely rewrite of the compress and decompress functions.
	  compress speedup 25-50% (user cpu time).
	  decompress speedup 20-30% (user cpu time).
	* Add special fast compress hash algorithm.
	* Fix some minor things.
	* use #include <utime.h> if available.
	* Cleanup the source code (I think so).
	* Test if filename is not to long. This is done on runtime no fix length
	  size any more.
	* Powerful build script (test almost every thing).

Modifications for version 4.1:
	* Added -r command line flag to allow recursive compression/
	  decompression of directory trees. As a side-effect, compress
	  no longer tries to compress/decompress anything that isn't
	  a regular file. In particular, it ignores symbolic links.
	* zcat no longer cares whether a filename ends in .Z or
	  not - it relies on the magic number in the file. If zcat
	  is given a filename that doesn't end with .Z and the file
	  referenced doesn't exist, zcat will append a .Z and try
	  to open that instead.
	* compress -f will now compress multiply hardlinked files.
	  Uncompress does not recreate the hard link, it creates
	  a new file.
	* Removed compressdir/uncompressdir - no longer needed.
	* Removed atob/btoa/tarmail/untarmail - my versions are
	  based on btoa 5.2 which is not compatible with the atob
	  included with compress4.0.

Compress version 4.0 improvements:
	* compress() speedup (10-50%) by changing division hash to xor
	* decompress() speedup (5-10%)
	* Memory requirements reduced (3-30%)
	* Stack requirements reduced to less than 4kb
	* Removed 'Big+Fast' compress code (FBITS) because of compress speedup
	* Portability mods for Z8000 and PC/XT (but not zeus 3.2)
	* Default to 'quiet' mode
	* Unification of 'force' flags
	* Manual page overhaul
	* Portability enhancement for M_XENIX
	* Removed text on #else and #endif
	* Added "-V" switch to print version and options
	* Added #defines for SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW
	* Added Makefile and "usermem" program
	* Removed all floating point computations
	* Removed ferror() calls in output routine on every output except first
	* New programs:
		compressdir - compress all files on a directory
		uncompressdir - uncompress all files on a directory
		zcmp - cmp compressed files
		zdiff - diff compressed files
	  The following are with thanks to philabs!per:
		btoa - convert binary to ascii for mailing
		atob - convert ascii to binary with checksum
		tarmail - tar, compress, btoa, and mail files
		untarmail - restore "tarmail" files

		WARNING: These last few programs are not compatible
		with the original ones from the net.  The encoding
		has changed.  See btoa.c for more info.

Compress version 3.6:
	* Remove much wasted storage by overlaying hash table with the tables

Compress version 3.5:
	* Change hash function to use exclusive-or.
	* Rip out hash cache.

Compress version 2.6:
	* Vary size of hash tables to reduce time for small files.
	* Tune PDP-11 hash function.

	  double hashing, discussed within.
	* Make block compression standard.

Compress version 2.4:
	* Introduce adaptive reset for block compression, to boost the rate
	  another several percent.  (See mailing list notes.)

	* Implemented REVERSE sorting of tab_next.
	* Bug fix for last bits.
	* Changed fwrite to putchar loop everywhere.

	* Fold in news changes, small machine typedef from thomas,
	* #ifdef interdata from joe.

Compress version 2.1:
	* Configured fast table lookup for 32-bit machines.
	* This cuts user time in half for b <= FBITS, and is useful for news
	* batching from VAX to PDP sites.
	* Also sped up decompress() [fwrite->putc] and added signal catcher
	  [plus beef in write_error()] to delete effluvia.

Compress version 2.0:
	* Add check for foreground before prompting user.
	* Insert maxbits into compressed file.
	* Force file being uncompressed to end with ".Z".
	* Added "-c" flag and "zcat".
	* Prepared for release.

	* Will only compress regular files (no directories).
	* Added a magic number header.
	* Plus an undocumented -n flag to handle old files without headers.

	  otherwise the user is prompted for a response.
	* Will tack on a .Z to a filename if it doesn't have one when decompressing.
	* Will only replace file if it was compressed.

Compress version 1.9:
	* Removed scanargs() & getopt().

	* Changed structure to arrays to save much memory.
	* Do unsigned compares where possible (faster on Perkin-Elmer).

Compress version 1.4:
	* Clean up the code a little and lint it.  (Lint complains about all
	  the regs used in the asm, but I'm not going to "fix" this.)

Compress version 1.3:
	* Minor fixes.

Compress version 1.2:
	* Add variable bit length output.
